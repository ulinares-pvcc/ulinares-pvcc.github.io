  <tr>
    <td>Operating System</td>
    <td>The software that controls the overall operation of a computer. It provides the means by which a user can store and retrieve files, provides the interface by which a user can request the execution of programs, and provides the environment necessary to excute the programs requested.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Job Queue</td>
    <td>The jobs residing in mass storage wait for execution.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FIFO</td>
    <td>First-in, first-out. That is, the objects are removed from the queue in the order in which they arrived.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Interactive Processing</td>
    <td>Operating systems were developed that allowed a program being executed to carry on a dialogue with the user through remote terminals.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Time-Sharing Multiprocessing</td>
    <td>Provides service to multiple users at the same time by dividing time into intervals and then execution of each job is restricted to one interval at a time.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Application Software</td>
    <td>Consists of the programs for performing tasks particular to the machine’s utilization.
System Software- Performs those tasks that are common to computer systems in general.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Utility Software</td>
    <td>Consists of programs for performing activities that are fundamental to computer installations but not included in the operating system.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</td>
    <td>Methods of manupilating files and programs, are represented pictorially on the display as icons. These systems allow users to issue commands by using one of several common input devices.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Shell</td>
    <td>Communicating with users through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor screen.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Kernel</td>
    <td>The internal part of an operating system. Contains those software components that perform the very basic functions required by the computer installation.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Device Driver</td>
    <td>The software units that communicate with the controllers (or at times, directly with peripheral devices) to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>File Manager</td>
    <td>Maintains records of all the files stored in mass storage, including where each file is located, which users are allowed to access the various files, and which portions of mass storage are available for new files or extensions to existing files.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Memory Manager</td>
    <td>Charged with the task of coordinating the machine’s use of main memory. Such duties are minimal in an environment in which a computer is asked to perform only one task at a time.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Virtual Memory</td>
    <td>Large “fictional” memory space created by paging.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Boot Strapping</td>
    <td>Transfers the operating system from mass storage (where it is permanently stored) into main memory (which is essentially empty when the machine is first turned on).</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>ROM- Read-only Memory</td>
    <td>A small portion of a computer’s main memory where the CPU expects to find its initial program is constructed from special nonvolatile memory cells.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Deadlock</td>
    <td>The condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Spooling</td>
    <td>The operating system would make the nonshareable resource appear shareable by creating the illusion of more than one printer.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Super User (or administrator)</td>
    <td>A person gains highly privileged access to the operating system during the login procedure.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Multi-factor Authentication</td>
    <td>One solution to the pervasive problem of humans using weak password to secure their computer accounts is to require more than one piece of evidence to gain access.</td>

    <td>Machine Language</td>
    <td>A branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Debugging</td>
    <td>A task that often leads to errors that must be located and corrected before the job is finished.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Assembler</td>
    <td>Developed to convert mnemonic expressions into machine language instructions.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Assembly Language</td>
    <td>A mnemonic system for representing programs is collectively.</td>

    <tr>
    <td>Compiler</td>
    <td>A special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>Interpreter</td>
    <td>A computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.</td>

    <tr>
    <td>High-level programming language</td>
    <td>Provide more abstractions for the programmer and make it easier for people to read and write a program. They leverage millions
of lines of library code, invoke built-in operating system functions, or initiate complex interactions with networks and databases.</td>
